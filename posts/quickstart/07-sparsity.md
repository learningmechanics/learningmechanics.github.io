[TO BE WRITTEN]


- subject of a lot of mechinterp, rather less mathematical theory
- studies of ICA (as opposed to PCA)
- L1-norm over L2-norm
- some of Arthur’s work (deep nets induce some kind of L1-ish sparsity)
    - esp from small init!
- “condensation phenomenon”
- some of Dan Kunin’s recent work (AGF)
- Q: can you study neuron densities and avoid worrying about neuron sparsity?
- Q: do inf-width muP nets learn sparsity? (probably, right? so does that mean Anthropic’s superposition hyp is wrong?)
